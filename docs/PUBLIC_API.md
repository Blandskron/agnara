# Public API Stability

This document owns compatibility expectations for Agnara's Python API.
`docs/API_DESIGN.md` owns the intended shape and examples; the machine-readable
[`public-api.json`](public-api.json) file owns the exact classified export list.

## Stability vocabulary

| Classification | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `stable` | Compatibility is promised under the stable release policy. Breaking changes require a major release. |
| `provisional` | Intentionally public and expected to remain recognizable, but pre-1.0 feedback may require an incompatible change. |
| `experimental` | Public only for evaluation. It may change or disappear in the next pre-1.0 release. |
| `internal` | Unsupported implementation detail. Internal names are excluded from public manifests and `__all__`. |

No API is classified `stable` during the alpha line. The 41 current exports of
the `agnara` top-level module are all `provisional`: they are deliberate public
entry points, but `0.1.0a3` explicitly makes no compatibility promise. A stable
classification requires a later, explicit decision supported by the beta and
release-candidate gates; descriptive phrases such as "stable identifier" do
not silently promote a Python symbol.

This first governed surface is exactly `agnara.__all__`. Public subpackage
surfaces such as `agnara.execution`, `agnara.core.di` and
`agnara.introspection` remain public and documented, but need their own
follow-up manifests. A count is not a substitute: the release gate compares
the ordered names and classifications in the manifest with the implementation.

## Change policy

- Every public addition must enter the manifest with an explicit
  classification in the same change.
- Removing or renaming a provisional API before 1.0 requires a `Changed` or
  `Removed` changelog entry and concrete migration guidance, as ADR 0021
  already requires for pre-1.0 breaks.
- Experimental APIs require a changelog entry when changed or removed;
  migration guidance is provided when a replacement exists.
- Stable APIs are deprecated before removal and may be removed only in a new
  major release. The minimum supported deprecation window will be decided
  before any symbol is promoted to stable.
- Internal names carry no compatibility promise and must not be imported by
  examples, generated projects or integration tests exercising public usage.
- Security fixes may shorten a deprecation path, but the changelog must state
  that exception without disclosing embargoed details.

The manifest is a review gate, not an automatic stability promotion. Updating
the snapshot makes a change explicit; it does not make that change compatible.
