# Changelog

Notable changes to Agnara are recorded here. The format is inspired by Keep a
Changelog, and release versions follow the synchronized PEP 440 policy in ADR
0021.

All work listed below is unreleased. The repository has no release tag yet;
package version `0.0.0` is a development sentinel, not a published release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Python 3.14 workspace with seven explicit package boundaries and
  cross-platform quality gates.
- Protocol-neutral `CapabilityId` and `CapabilityDefinition` value types with
  effects, risk, confirmation and idempotency metadata.
- Issue/branch/PR/review governance, branch rulesets and evidence-based
  AI-agent attribution.
- Synchronized pre-1.0 package versioning and a curated changelog/release
  workflow ([#16]).
- Capability-first architecture for generated OpenAPI, replaceable HTTP
  documentation providers and protocol-neutral Agnara Explorer introspection.
- `CapabilityRegistry` and `FrozenCapabilityRegistry`: deterministic
  registration order, duplicate-id rejection, a freeze step that yields an
  immutable thread-safe view, lookup by id or dotted string, and
  introspection by namespace and declared effect ([#19]).

### Changed

- Core frozen value types retain slots while using one internal construction
  rule for deterministic mutation failures.

### Fixed

- Unknown assignment or deletion on frozen slotted core values now raises
  `FrozenInstanceError` instead of CPython 3.14's confusing internal
  `TypeError` ([#3]).
